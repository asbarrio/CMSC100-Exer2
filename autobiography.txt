My name is Antoni Barrio. I was born on December 15, 2001.
My parents are Antonio Barrio and Ofelia Barrio. Since
I was a Senior High School, I dreamt of being a Statistician.

I am currently in College and I am one step closer on being
a full-time Statistician. I hope to graduate by next year
to start working and earn a lot of money :D
